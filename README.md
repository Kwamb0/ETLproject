# ETLproject
At the end of the week, your team will submit a Final Report that describes the following:  Extract: your original data sources and how the data was formatted (CSV, JSON, pgAdmin 4, etc).  Transform: what data cleaning or transformation was required.  Load: the final database, tables/collections, and why this was chosen.  Please upload the report to Github and submit a link to Bootcampspot.
